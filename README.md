An open-source MERN Stack application bringing you fake news that matters. 

Our application is called FINN - Fake News Network, with an i in the middle for memorable and easier pronunciation.

In the 21st century, information overload is a problem as never before. It is so much of a problem that in 2009, the Harvard Business Review published an article called “Death by Information Overload” (https://hbr.org/2009/09/death-by-information-overload). And in the past 9 years, the amount of information bombarding our senses has exploded like never before - we can now get the news from our tvs, computers, tablets, phones, car radios, Alexa, and even our watches.

Unfortunately, not all of this information is true or reliable, or put forth by well-meaning actors. There are many forms of fake news, and the problem of fake news has taken on even more urgency as there is evidence that it has affected the election process, or caused harassment of real life individuals, or influenced social and purchasing choices.

One type of site — satire sites like the Onion — are notable for openly being fake news. However, these articles still get sent and passed around as if they are real news. The problem is so prevalent that even our national leaders can get confused. More than one politician has cited a satirical article as fact, e.g. https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/381847-la-state-lawmaker-cites-satirical-article-in-argument-against.

Perhaps these national leaders — not to mention the populace at large — would not get so confused if there was a place they could read satirical articles, and see exactly how these related to the real news of the day. From market research, we have determined that real news and satirical news sites are currently kept on separate sites, so that it is not obvious how a satire article relates to the news of the day unless one has already spent several minutes browsing a so-called “real” news site. It is time for a new paradigm in order to help us navigate through the 21st century in the age of information overload: the fake news network, that openly displays fake news — but with an important and heretofore never before seen twist — the ability to see the relevant real news stories.

Our app will allow the user to browse openly fake news stories from popular satire sites, and click on a button called “Show Related Real News” to see the real news stories that inspired the satire. With this mechanism, an individual can be both entertained by satiric comedy, and still kept informed of the news of the day in a way that is most pertinent to them and helps reduce information overload. Additionally, our app will be one tool — amongst many - to help combat the false news epidemic.
